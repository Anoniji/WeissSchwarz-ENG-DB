        ],
        "ability": [
            "【AUTO】 When this card is placed on the stage from your hand, put the top 2 cards of your deck into your waiting room. If there is a climax revealed among those cards, this card gets +3000 power until end of turn.",
            "【AUTO】 [(1) Put the top card of your deck into your clock] When this card is placed on the stage from your hand, you may pay the cost. If you do, choose 1 level 1 or lower character in your waiting room, and return it to your hand."

        "flavor_text": "-",
        "set": "CCS",
        "release": "X01",
